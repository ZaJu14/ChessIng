              Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered
              board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid, where each player
              starts with 16 pieces and aims to checkmate the opponent's king.

              A chessboard is a gameboard used to play chess. It consists of 64
              squares, 8 rows <abc>(ranks)</abc> by 8 columns
              <abc> (files)</abc>, on which the chess pieces are placed. It is
              square in shape and uses two colours of squares, one light and one
              dark, in a chequered pattern.

              Historically, many different notation systems have been used to
              record chess moves; the standard system today is short-form
              algebraic notation. In this system, each square is uniquely
              identified by a set of coordinates, a to h for the files (Columns)
              followed by 1 to 8 for the ranks (Rows).

          <h3>Ratings.</h3>
          <div class="centeringp">
            A chess rating system is a system used in chess to estimate the
            strength of a player, based on their performance versus other
            players. They are used by organizations such as FIDE
            <abc>(Fédération Internationale des Échecs) </abc>, the US Chess
            Federation (USCF or US Chess), International Correspondence Chess
            Federation, and the English Chess Federation. Most of the systems
            are used to recalculate ratings after a tournament or match but some
            are used to recalculate ratings after individual games. Popular
            online chess sites such as chess.com, Lichess, and Internet Chess
            Club also implement rating systems. In almost all systems, a higher
            number indicates a stronger player. In general, players' ratings go
            up if they perform better than expected and down if they perform
            worse than expected. The magnitude of the change depends on the
            rating of their opponents. The Elo rating system is currently the
            most widely used.

            Chess titles are recognitions given by chess federations to players
